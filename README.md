# Zeepkist Reinforcement Learning

Its an AI that learns to play the game Zeepkist, video demonstration https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWiTQtaJj7A

Its possible to train it with the code provided but its not easy, you need to be on Windows, have python 3.8-10 with the librairies in requirements.txt, have pytorch installed with CUDA and a powerful GPU (i have Nvidia RTX3070) so it plays at 20fps.

You also need to have a screen resolution of 1920x1080 and to have the game at a resolution of 1280x720 in the top left corner of the screen. And you might need to change some settings in zeep_env.py for it to work
